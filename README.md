# This program was implemented on AVR series AtMega 8 controller

# This repository contains a code for a five mode operable robot, which was developed for a robotic workshop - METEOR.
# Various modes of operation were selected through a mode select switch onn the robot.

# Five modes of operations are as listed below:
# 1. Manual Mode - Motion of the robot controlled through a customised remote.
# 2. Mobile operation - Motion of the robot was controlled via the key pad on mobile phones, using the concept of DTFM
# 3. Touch Screen operation - Motion of the  robot was controlled with a touch screen
# 4. Line Trace Operation - In this mode the robot would trace and traverse only on a white line. Line tracing was achieved using a series of Infrared Sensors
# 5. Obstacle Avoid Operation - In this mode the robot would avoid avoid any obstacle that comes in front of it during travelling. 
#				Infrares sensors were used to detect the obstacle.
